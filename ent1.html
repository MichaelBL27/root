<h4>How We Were Founded?</h4>
<p>Marvel was originally born with the name 'Time Publications' back in 1939. It came to be "Atlas Comics" in the 1950s. The company was founded by Martin Goodman who at the time was the publisher of the Pulp-magizine. The era of Marvel comics began in 1961 with the release of the "Fanastic Four." Below is a picture of the creator Martin Goodman back in 1941.</p>
